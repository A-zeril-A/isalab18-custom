Custom Project Profitability Dashboard
======================================

This module extends the official Odoo Project module by inheriting and enhancing the Project Updates feature.
It provides a comprehensive profitability dashboard for each project, integrating HR team cost calculation,
facilities costs, taxes, and other financial KPIs directly into the project interface.

Key Features
------------
- Full Integration with Project Updates:** Inherits and customizes the Project Updates functionality from the official Odoo Project module, ensuring seamless user experience.
- HR Team Cost Calculation:** Automatically calculates and reports HR costs per project, based on timesheet data and employee cost rates.
- Profitability & Financial KPIs:** Integrates essential financial indicators (costs, margin, taxes, facilities) into the project dashboard for real-time analysis.
- Custom Security Groups:** Restricts access to sensitive financial data via dedicated security groups, ensuring data privacy and compliance.
- Enhanced User Interface:** Customizes project kanban and update views for improved usability and clarity, including renaming and extending key actions.
- Real-Time Reporting:** All calculations and dashboards are updated in real time, providing project managers with up-to-date insights.

How It Works
------------
- The module inherits the Project Updates feature and injects advanced financial calculations into the project dashboard.
- HR costs are calculated per user based on timesheet entries and employee cost rates.
- Facilities costs, taxes, and other expenses are automatically included in the profitability analysis.
- All enhancements are fully integrated with the standard Odoo Project workflow, requiring no additional configuration.

Intended Audience
-----------------
This module is ideal for organizations seeking real-time insight into project profitability and cost structure, especially those with complex HR and financial requirements.
